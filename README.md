## Ippotim语言是什么？
  Ippotim语言是一门类C语言，仅保留了最基本的语法特性，或许是现有的最精巧的程序设计语言。
## What is Ippotim?
  The Ippotim Programming Language is a C-like Programming Language that retains only the most basic syntactic features, perhaps the most elaborate programming language available.

## Ippotim语言有什么用？
  Ippotim语言语法简明易懂，而且是专门为图形编程而设计的，非常适合用作程序设计的启蒙教学，上至计算机科班生下至中小学生都会有很愉快的学习使用体验。
  事实上Ippotim语言是笔者为实现AI编程专门设计的一门程序设计语言，因为它足够精巧，你可以很容易基于它实现AI算法，而不必为现有的程序设计语言的复杂的语法伤脑筋，从而可以专注于算法设计本身。
## What is the Ippotim for?
  Ippotim's syntax is simple and easy to understand, and it is specially designed for graphic programming. It is very suitable for the enlightenment teaching of programming. Students from the computer science class to primary and secondary school will have a pleasant learning experience.
  In fact, Ippotim is a programming language specially designed by me for the implementation of AI programming. Because it is delicate enough, you can easily implement AI algorithms based on it without having to worry about the complex syntax of existing programming languages, thus focusing on the algorithm design itself.

## 你为Ippotim语言做了哪些工作？
  笔者设计了Ippotim语言的基本语法，并用Java实现了一个小巧的解释器以及桌面端和安卓端两个图形界面程序（算是IDE吧），还提供了一些简单的演示程序，说明文档《The Ippotim Programming Language》也正在编写中，后续会上传到Ippotim Docs项目中。
  顺便说一下，笔者为Ippotim语言设计了一个logo，用“ippotim”的7个字符拼成了汉字的“谧”字。
## What have you done for Ippotim？
  I designed The basic syntax of Ippotim, implemented a small interpreter in Java, and two graphical interface programs (maybe IDE) on Desktop and Android, and provided some simple demos. The documentation, "The Ippotim Programming Language", is also in the works and will be shipped to The Ippotim Docs project.
  By the way, I designed a logo for Ippotim, using seven characters of "Ippotim" to show the Chinese character "谧".

## Ippotim语言后续的发展规划是什么？
  Ippotim语言的语法设计在经历了笔者的几次调整下已经趋于稳定，但不排除未来因为有了更精巧的设计而再次修改的可能，只是这种可能应该微乎其微了。
  现有的Ippotim语言的解释器还没有实现严谨的基于文法分析的语法检查功能，对于某些代码会不能正确处理甚至会抛出异常，后续会补上。
  Ippotim语言一开始就是为了AI编程而设计的，平台搭建好后就可以向AI编程进军了。AI编程是如此的激动人心，希望志同道合的朋友们能加入我们万众一心攻下这一城。
## What is the future development plan of Ippotim？
  The syntax design of Ippotim has been stable after several adjustments made by me, but the possibility of further modifications due to more elaborate designs is not ruled out, but it seems unlikely.
  The existing Ippotim interpreter do not yet implement rigorous syntax-based syntax checking, and some code will fail to handle or even throw an exception, which will be covered later.
  Ippotim was designed for AI programming at the beginning, and after the platform is built, we can enter into AI programming. AI programming is so exciting, we hope that like-minded friends can join us in the fight to achieve this goal.

## 如何加入你们？
  因为Ippotim语言力求精简，所以实际上平台的搭建和维护工作并不需要太多的人来做。但AI编程毫无疑问是一个巨大的挑战，我们需要更多人的智慧来寻求突破。
  如果你发现了现有代码的不足或者想到或实现了一些很棒的功能，可以直接联系笔者（ippotim@yeah.net），我们很欢迎你的加入。
  如果你有了AI编程的一个新颖有效的想法，毫无疑问你也会是学界或业界的翘楚，如果你愿意跟我们共享你的创意，也直接联系笔者吧（ippotim@yeah.net）。
## How to join you？
  Since The Ippotim Programming Language is stripped-down, actually it doesn't take too many people to build and maintain the platform. But AI programming is undoubtedly a huge challenge, we need more people's wisdom to find breakthroughs.
  If you have noticed a lack of existing code or have thought of or implemented some great features, you can contact me directly (ippotim@yeah.net).You are welcome to join us.
  If you have a new and effective idea of AI programming, you will no doubt be an outstanding person in academy or company. If you are willing to share your ideas with us, please contact me directly(ippotim@yeah.net).
